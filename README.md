# Complexity Economics and Sustainable Development
## A Computational Toolkit for Policy Priority Inference

### by Omar A. Guerrero and Gonzalo Casta√±eda

This is the repository of the book [Complexity Economics and Sustainable Developmenmt](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/complexity-economics-and-sustainable-development/BD6CCB51DF29A5FE3638B3B99C7D0CB1) (2024, Cambridge University Press). Here, you can find all the scripts to reproduce the simulation results presented in the book. To run the code, just clone the repository locally and, assuming you have the necessary Python libraries, you should be able to run every script as long as you do not modify the folder scructure.

More information about the Policy Priority Inference programme of research can be found in [policypriority.org](https://policypriority.org).
